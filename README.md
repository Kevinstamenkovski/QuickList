**QuickList**

Application made by _Kevin Stamenkovski_, _Federico Gabutti_ and _Alessandro Montalbano_.

This is an Android Application made for a school project, in which we used a `SQLite Database` to save the users data and `many designs` made by the team members

The main purpose of this application is to make the trip to the grocery store more organized, giving the user a way to list everything he needs in a simple way
